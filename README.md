# DRC Rule Checker

A modular Python engine for validating layout blocks against a configurable DRC rule deck. Inspired by physical verification tools like Synopsys IC Validator and Calibre, this project simulates spacing, enclosure, and connectivity checks using structured layout data and YAML-based rule decks.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This tool reads layout data from a JSON file and applies design rule checks (DRC) defined in a YAML rule deck. It identifies violations, tags severity levels, and generates a summary report. Designed for academic chip design, early-stage layout compliance, and rule deck prototyping.
